# Selma's HW2 Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio

## Description:

In this portfolio, we are building the beginnings of our website/porfolio that hosts information about us and our work. It stores an 'about me' page, contact page, and a portfolio of our work. This website was built using mostly bootstrap with tiny bits of css tweaking for minor changes to fonts and colors. I added various bootstrap components as well as utilities. These included a navigation bar, contact information, cards, the grid, spacing/margin/padding mechanisms, and containers. This website is going to be the foundation and external display of my work. I will be able to build upon it as we progress to showcase my frontend.
