Selma's HW2 Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio

Description:

In this homework, we are building the beginnings of our website that hosts information about us. It stores an 'about me' page, contact page, and a portfolio of our work. This website was built using mostly bootstrap with tiny bits of css file usage for minor changes to the text. I added various bootstrap components as well as utilities. These include a navigation bar, contact information,

A couple of things I learned in this:

* I approached this homework completely incorrect in the first place and this delayed me. I had very detailed modifications of margins and spacing by the pixel and realized late that it would not help me with maintaining a responsive website. I had to backtrack and start to use spacing conventions in Bootstrap.
* I learned that Bootstrap containers are theoretical containers that actually do not have physical containers. I found out very late that the Bootstrap card-body class would be my best friend in creating the actual physical containers I needed.
* I utilized a Google Chrome color eyedrop extension to pull the hexidecimal color results from the screenshots on Gitlab. I also found another way to do this was through opening the images in Paint and setting an eyedrop to find out the r,g,b numbers.
* I had 3-4 different CSS files and could hardly manage, so I consolidated to one CSS file and three HTML files.
* I learned along the way that I needed both a Bootstrap stylesheet and the Javascript plugin. I did not realize this until 3 days before submitting this assignment. It helped me add in the utilities I needed, like cards and spacing.

The hardest thing for me was deciding when to use the tags section, article, figure, etc. It's very hazy to me how those are different, so I will need to continue understanding that.
